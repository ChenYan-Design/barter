									<h1>About</h1>
								</header>
								<p>Started by asking the question "What resources can we exchange from the people around us?" I decided to do an experimental project called Barter Challenge. I started with a pin, which is probably the most common thing you can see in our studio, and got a bracelet by exchanging the pin. By playing the middleman role, I show the item I got from the last person to the next person and ask if they're willing to exchange with me with any item they have with them. While exchanging, I ask everyone two questions: 1. What do you do? 2. What's the story between you and this item? The process and result is totally accidental and uncontrolled.</p>
